   abstract = {At the forefront of cognitive neuroscience research in normal humans are the new techniques of functional brain imaging: positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The signal used by positron emission tomog-raphy is based on the fact that changes in the cellular activity of the brain of normal, awake humans and laboratory animals are accompanied almost invariably by changes in local blood flow. This robust, empirical relationship has fascinated scientists for well over a hundred years. Because the changes in blood flow are accompanied by lesser changes in oxygen consumption, local changes in brain oxygen content occur at the sites of activation and provide the basis for the signal used by magnetic resonance imaging. The biological basis for these signals is now an area of intense research stimulated by the interest in these tools for cognitive neuroscience research.},

   abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a unique view of the working human mind. The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, detected in fMRI, reflects changes in deoxyhemoglobin driven by localized changes in brain blood flow and blood oxygenation, which are coupled to underlying neuronal activity by a process termed neurovascular coupling. Over the past 10 years, a range of cellular mechanisms, including astrocytes, pericytes, and interneurons, have been proposed to play a role in functional neurovascular coupling. However, the field remains conflicted over the relative importance of each process, while key spatiotemporal features of BOLD response remain unexplained. Here, we review current candidate neurovascular coupling mechanisms and propose that previously overlooked involvement of the vascular endothelium may provide a more complete picture of how blood flow is controlled in the brain. We also explore the possibility and consequences of conditions in which neurovascular coupling may be altered, including during postnatal development, pathological states, and aging, noting relevance to both stimulus-evoked and resting-state fMRI studies. © Copyright ©2014 by Annual Reviews.

   abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a methodology for detecting dynamic patterns of activity in the working human brain. Although the initial discoveries that led to fMRI are only about 20 years old, this new field has revolutionized the study of brain function. The ability to detect changes in brain activity has a biophysical basis in the magnetic properties of deoxyhemoglobin, and a physiological basis in the way blood flow increases more than oxygen metabolism when local neural activity increases. These effects translate to a subtle increase in the local magnetic resonance signal, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect, when neural activity increases. With current techniques, this pattern of activation can be measured with resolution approaching 1 mm3 spatially and 1 s temporally. This review focuses on the physical basis of the BOLD effect, the imaging methods used to measure it, the possible origins of the physiological effects that produce a mismatch of blood flow and oxygen metabolism during neural activation, and the mathematical models that have been developed to understand the measured signals. An overarching theme is the growing field of quantitative fMRI, in which other MRI methods are combined with BOLD methods and analyzed within a theoretical modeling framework to derive quantitative estimates of oxygen metabolism and other physiological variables. That goal is the current challenge for fMRI: to move fMRI from a mapping tool to a quantitative probe of brain physiology. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin in venous blood is a naturally occurring contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By accentuating the effects of this agent through the use of gradient-echo techniques in high fields, we demonstrate in vivo images of brain microvasculature with image contrast reflecting the blood oxygen level. This blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast follows blood oxygen changes induced by anesthetics, by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and by inhaled gas mixtures that alter metabolic demand or blood flow. The results suggest that BOLD contrast can be used to provide in vivo real-time maps of blood oxygenation in the brain under normal physiological conditions. BOLD contrast adds an additional feature to magnetic resonance imaging and complements other techniques that are attempting to provide positron emission tomography-like measurements related to regional neural activity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely accepted modality for providing anatomical information. Current research (1) involves extending MRI methods to provide information about biological function, in addition to the con-comitant anatomical information. In addition to localized spectroscopy (2) and chemical shift imaging (3) that are applicable to many chemical species, MRI of water protons has been functionally extended to NMR angiography (4), perfusion imaging (5, 6), and perfusion imaging enhanced by exogenous contrast agents (7). Since water is by far the predominant molecule in tissue, and since its signal dominates the information content in proton images, one would ideally like to exploit changes in the water signal that arise from physiological events. Except for cases of water movement , such as blood flow, these changes are normally very small. It has previously been demonstrated (8, 9) that the presence of deoxyhemoglobin in blood changes the proton signal from water molecules surrounding a blood vessel in gradient-echo MRI, producing blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. BOLD contrast has its origin in the fact that when normally diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin gives up its oxygen, the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is paramagnetic. The presence of paramagnetic molecules in blood produces a difference in magnetic susceptibility between the blood vessel and the surrounding tissue. This susceptibility difference is "felt" both by the water molecules in the blood and by those in the surrounding tissue, the effect extending significantly beyond the vessel wall. This increase in the number of spins affected by deoxyhemoglobin is a form of amplification. When the susceptibility-induced local field differences exist within an imaging voxel, there is a resultant distribution of shifts in water resonance frequencies. In the gradient-echo method, a phase dispersion of water proton signals is produced at the echo time. This dispersion reduces the signal intensity and the voxel appears dark in the image. These intensity losses, which at high magnetic fields (-4 T) extend significantly beyond the boundary of the blood vessel, are the source of BOLD contrast. This form of contrast is not observed in spin-echo images. Through simulations (9), we have shown that vessels as small as 50 ,um in diameter can be detected in images with a pixel size of 100 pum. We have also demonstrated that the size of the susceptibility-induced local field depends on (i) the concentration of paramagnetic deox-yhemoglobin and (ii) the orientation of the vessel relative to the main magnetic field (8, 9). Since BOLD contrast depends on the state of blood oxygenation, physiological events that change the oxy/ deoxyhemoglobin ratio should lend themselves to noninva-sive detection through the accentuation of BOLD contrast in gradient-echo proton images at high magnetic fields. We report here that this is indeed the case and demonstrate changes in BOLD-contrast microimages ofbrain produced by changes in inhaled gas mixture under urethane anesthesia, by insulin-induced hypoglycemia under diazepam sedation, and by changes in the level of halothane anesthesia. The observed changes in BOLD contrast correlate with the anticipated changes in blood oxygen level produced by altered metabolic load or blood flow (10). MATERIALS AND METHODS Physiology and Anesthetics. Sprague-Dawley rats (female, 250 ± 25 g) were anesthetized with the described anesthetics and ventilated without assistance. Animal care and the administration of anesthetics were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. For MRI experiments, the animal was placed in a thermally regulated compartment within the magnet and rectal temperature and electrocardio-gram were monitored. Blood was periodically sampled from the femoral artery and blood gas concentrations were measured with a Radiometer model ABL330 gas analyzer. Blood glucose was estimated using a Boehringer-Mannheim Accu-Check Ilm. To measure the electroencephalogram (EEG) during MRI experiments, small tubular salt bridges (0.8 mm i.d.) were implanted in small holes through the skull that were located inside the area encircled by the surface coil used for NMR signal detection. Care was taken not to break the dura. Magnetic Resonance Microimaging. Gradient-echo images were obtained with a 7-T horizontal magnet at 300 MHz (Spectroscopy Imaging Systems, Fremont, CA). Surface coils of 20 to 25-mm diameter were positioned on the surface of the cranium and used for both excitation and detection of signals. The maximum field gradient used to produce images was 4 G/cm (1 G = 0.1 mT). The slice width of the images shown was 500 ,4m and the in-plane pixel size was 117 ,um X Abbreviations: MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; BOLD, blood oxygenation level-dependent; EEG, electroencephalogram. 9868 The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

   abstract = {Optical brain imaging has seen 30 years of intense development, and has grown into a rich and diverse field. In-vivo imaging using light provides unprecedented sensitivity to functional changes through intrinsic contrast, and is rapidly exploiting the growing availability of exogenous optical contrast agents. Light can be used to image microscopic structure and function in vivo in exposed animal brain, while also allowing noninvasive imaging of hemodynamics and metabolism in a clinical setting. This work presents an overview of the wide range of approaches currently being applied to in-vivo optical brain imaging, from animal to man. Techniques include multispectral optical imaging, voltage sensitive dye imaging and speckle-flow imaging of exposed cortex, in-vivo two-photon microscopy of the living brain, and the broad range of noninvasive topography and tomography approaches to near-infrared imaging of the human brain. The basic principles of each technique are described, followed by examples of current applications to cutting-edge neuroscience research. In summary, it is shown that optical brain imaging continues to grow and evolve, embracing new technologies and advancing to address ever more complex and important neuroscience questions.},

   abstract = {The role of magnetism in the biological functioning of hemoglobin has been debated since its discovery by Pauling and Coryell in 1936. The hemoglobin molecule contains four heme groups each having a porphyrin layer with a Fe ion at the center. Here, we present combined density-functional theory and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for an effective model of Fe in a heme cluster. In comparison with these calculations, we analyze the experimental data on human adult hemoglobin (HbA) from the magnetic susceptibility, Mössbauer and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) measurements. In both the deoxygenated (deoxy) and the oxygenated (oxy) cases, we show that local magnetic moments develop in the porphyrin layer with antiferromagnetic coupling to the Fe moment. Our calculations reproduce the magnetic susceptibility measurements on deoxy and oxy-HbA. For deoxy-HbA, we show that the anomalous MCD signal in the UV region is an experimental evidence for the presence of antiferromagnetic Fe-porphyrin correlations. The functional properties of hemoglobin such as the binding of O2, the Bohr effect and the cooperativity are explained based on the magnetic correlations. This analysis suggests that magnetism could be involved in the functioning of hemoglobin.},
